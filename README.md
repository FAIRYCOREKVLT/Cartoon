Funny console animation. 2 versions: coloured and monochrome (second is easier to edit). You can make an .exe file by running 'install.py' and 'compile_exe.py' and amuse your friends.
Customize animation speed (time.sleep()) if needed.
Added compiled .exe file.

Contact me if you meet any errors or have any ideas, I'll be thankful.
